# Product Context: notes2vec

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional search tools like `grep` or full-text search engines only find exact keyword matches. This creates fundamental problems for personal knowledge management:

- **Vocabulary Mismatch**: You might write a note about "persistent storage" but later search for "database mechanisms" and get no results
- **Evolving Terminology**: Your vocabulary changes over time, making old notes hard to find
- **Concept-Based Discovery**: You can't find notes based on ideas or concepts, only exact words
- **The Forgetful Writer Problem**: You don't remember the exact words you used, only what you meant

## Target Users

### Primary Personas

1. **Knowledge Workers**: Professionals with large personal note collections who need to quickly find information across years of accumulated notes
2. **Developers**: Technical writers maintaining documentation who need to locate specific implementation details or explanations
3. **Researchers**: Academics organizing papers and notes who need to find related concepts across their collection
4. **Anyone Frustrated with Keyword Search**: Users who have tried traditional search tools and found them inadequate for their personal knowledge base

### User Stories

**As a knowledge worker**, I want to search for "how to configure database" and find notes about "persistent storage setup" so that I can discover information even when I use different terminology.

**As a developer**, I want my notes automatically indexed when I save them so that I don't have to manually trigger indexing operations.

**As a privacy-conscious user**, I want all my notes processed locally so that sensitive information never leaves my computer.

**As a user with limited resources**, I want the tool to run efficiently on my laptop without requiring dedicated GPU hardware or excessive RAM.

## User Experience Flow

### Initial Setup
1. User runs `notes2vec init`
2. System sets up local database and downloads embedding model (one-time operation)
3. User is ready to index their notes

### Indexing
1. User runs `notes2vec index /path/to/notes`
2. System scans directories, respects .gitignore, parses Markdown
3. Progress is shown, and indexing completes automatically
4. User can now search their notes

### Continuous Updates
1. User runs `notes2vec watch /path/to/notes` (daemon mode)
2. System monitors file changes in the background
3. Changes are automatically indexed without user intervention
4. Search results always reflect the latest state of notes

### Searching
1. User runs `notes2vec search "query about what they're looking for"`
2. System converts query to vector and finds semantically similar notes
3. Results are displayed in a TUI with ranked relevance
4. User can navigate and view full context of matching notes

## Critical Success Factors

### From User Perspective

1. **Accuracy**: Search results must be semantically relevant, not just keyword matches
2. **Speed**: Search must feel instant (< 1 second) for interactive use
3. **Transparency**: Users must understand what's being indexed and how
4. **Reliability**: Index must stay in sync with file system changes
5. **Simplicity**: Tool must be easy to install and use without technical expertise

### User Value Proposition

- **Time Savings**: Find information faster than manual browsing or keyword search
- **Discovery**: Uncover forgotten notes and connections between ideas
- **Privacy**: Complete control over personal data
- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connection
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal resource usage, doesn't slow down the system

## Product Vision

notes2vec aims to become the default semantic search tool for personal knowledge bases, enabling users to interact with their notes as a true "second brain" where finding information is as natural as thinking about it. The tool should feel invisible until needed—running quietly in the background, maintaining the index, and instantly surfacing relevant information when queried.
