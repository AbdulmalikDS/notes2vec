# Progress: notes2vec Development Status

## Project Status: Initialization Phase

**Overall Completion**: ~5% (Planning and documentation complete, implementation not started)

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Project description documented
- [x] Architecture research and analysis completed
- [x] Technology stack selected and documented
- [x] Memory bank initialized
- [x] Core requirements defined

## In Progress Tasks

- [~] Project setup and initialization

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Rust project with Cargo
- [ ] Configure Cargo.toml with all dependencies
- [ ] Set up project directory structure
- [ ] Create basic module architecture
- [ ] Set up development tooling (clippy, fmt, etc.)

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement configuration management (`~/.notes2vec/config.toml`)
- [ ] Implement `init` command (create directories, download model)
- [ ] Set up LanceDB database initialization
- [ ] Set up redb state store initialization
- [ ] Implement model downloading and caching

### Phase 3: File Discovery and Parsing
- [ ] Implement directory traversal with `ignore` crate
- [ ] Implement .gitignore respect logic
- [ ] Implement Markdown file detection
- [ ] Implement frontmatter extraction
- [ ] Implement Markdown parsing with `pulldown-cmark`
- [ ] Implement header hierarchy extraction
- [ ] Implement semantic chunking with context injection

### Phase 4: Embedding Pipeline
- [ ] Integrate Candle framework
- [ ] Implement model loading (nomic-embed-text-v1.5)
- [ ] Implement text tokenization
- [ ] Implement batch embedding generation
- [ ] Implement Matryoshka learning (vector truncation)

### Phase 5: Indexing System
- [ ] Implement change detection (hash comparison)
- [ ] Implement state store updates (redb)
- [ ] Implement vector storage in LanceDB
- [ ] Implement metadata storage
- [ ] Implement batch indexing pipeline
- [ ] Implement incremental update logic
- [ ] Add progress reporting for indexing

### Phase 6: File Watching
- [ ] Integrate `notify-debouncer-full`
- [ ] Implement file watcher setup
- [ ] Implement debounced event handling
- [ ] Implement change queue management
- [ ] Integrate with indexing pipeline
- [ ] Implement daemon mode (`watch` command)

### Phase 7: Search Functionality
- [ ] Implement query embedding
- [ ] Implement ANN search in LanceDB
- [ ] Implement result ranking
- [ ] Implement metadata filtering (if needed)
- [ ] Implement search command CLI

### Phase 8: User Interface
- [ ] Integrate ratatui for TUI
- [ ] Design search results display
- [ ] Implement result navigation
- [ ] Implement context display (surrounding text)
- [ ] Implement file path display
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts

### Phase 9: Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Implement structured logging with `tracing`
- [ ] Implement error types with `thiserror`
- [ ] Add error recovery strategies
- [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add logging levels and configuration

### Phase 10: Testing and Quality
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
- [ ] Write integration tests for pipelines
- [ ] Write performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add example test data
- [ ] Test with various Markdown formats
- [ ] Test with Obsidian and Notion exports

### Phase 11: Documentation
- [ ] Write user documentation (README)
- [ ] Write installation instructions
- [ ] Write usage examples
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### Phase 12: Polish and Release
- [ ] Optimize binary size
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Final testing on multiple platforms
- [ ] Create release binaries
- [ ] Prepare initial release

## Known Issues

None currently (project in early planning phase)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Hybrid search (semantic + keyword BM25)
- [ ] Image search using CLIP models
- [ ] LLM integration via MCP protocol
- [ ] Multiple note directory support
- [ ] Advanced filtering (tags, dates, etc.)
- [ ] Result reranking with bge-reranker
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Backup and restore

## Technical Debt

None currently (project not yet implemented)

## Notes

- Project follows "local-first" principles strictly
- Performance and privacy are top priorities
- Single binary distribution is a hard requirement
- Tool should feel "invisible" until needed
