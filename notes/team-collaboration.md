# Effective Team Collaboration

## Communication

Clear and frequent communication is the foundation of successful teamwork. Use appropriate channels for different types of communication - quick questions in chat, detailed discussions in meetings, and important decisions documented in writing.

## Code Collaboration

When working on shared codebases, coordinate with your team. Use version control effectively - create feature branches, write descriptive commit messages, and keep branches up to date. Before merging, ensure your code builds and tests pass.

## Knowledge Sharing

Don't hoard knowledge. Share what you learn through documentation, code comments, team presentations, or informal discussions. This helps the entire team grow and reduces bus factor.

## Conflict Resolution

Disagreements are natural in collaborative environments. When conflicts arise, focus on the problem, not the person. Listen to different perspectives, find common ground, and make decisions based on what's best for the project.

## Remote Work

For distributed teams, establish clear working hours and communication expectations. Use video calls for complex discussions, and be mindful of time zones. Over-communicate rather than under-communicate.

## Project Planning

Regular planning sessions help align team goals. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. Set realistic deadlines and adjust as needed. Track progress and celebrate milestones.
